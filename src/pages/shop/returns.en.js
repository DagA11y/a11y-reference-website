      <h2>Valid returns</h2>
      <p>
        Valid returns assumes that the goods have not been used, are in the same
        condition as when you received them, and all labels and price tags
        should still be attached. Goods with traces of make-up etc. are not
        considered to be in original condition and cannot therefore be returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we have made a mistake, or if the goods have a manufacturing error,
        you are entitled to return the goods, and we will pay to having them
